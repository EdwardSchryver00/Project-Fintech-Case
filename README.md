# Case Study - Coinbase

By Edward Schryver

---

## Overview and Origin
    Coinbase is a platform that allows the exchange of cryptocurrencies. It operates like the stock market for the various cryptocurrencies traded in the crypto market (Kathiravan et al., 2019). The company operates remotely and does not have a physical headquarters (Kathiravan et al., 2019). According to Crabb (2021), Coinbase was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam. Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam are technology and business enthusiasts who have a particular inclination on Cryptocurrency. 

    The idea behind Coinbase is particularly based on the background, passions, and views of the founders. According to Millar and Galyan (2017), Coinbase was founded when cryptocurrencies' popularity rose. Although Bitcoin had been a dominating Cryptocurrency by the time, in 2011, the creation of another popular Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, opened up the possibility for a surge in the number of varied cryptocurrencies that would require a platform for exchange. 

    According to Chawaga (2021), the company received its series A funding of $5 million in May of 2013. The funding was from a venture capital firm known as Union Square Ventures. Later the same year, other venture capital firms joined in and extended funding amounting to $25 million as an investment in the company. Chawaga (2021) shows that the company received a further $75 million investment in 2015 from various organizations and individuals, including the New York Stock Exchange as well as several banks. The company has thus received a total of USD 100 million in funding since its formation in 2012. 

## Business Activity

    According to Jackson (2018), for one to understand the Coinbase business activity, one must understand the Cryptocurrency landscape. Cryptocurrencies are currencies that operate using blockchain technology that allows them to be decentralized. Jackson (2018) argues that the idea of a central authority in governing the currencies is eliminated by designing the technology using shared ledgers. Based on this paradigm of operation, Jackson (2018) asserts that there are two emerging needs: the need for a system that trades the currencies within its paradigm of operation and one that uses cryptocurrencies for its operations. LeClair (2021) asserts that trading requires various regulations, data management processes, and approaches to transfer funds. 

    According to Zhao (2018), Coinbase provides a secure online platform that allows its users to buy, sell, transfer, and store digital currency. Zhao (2018) adds that the focus of the organization is to provide an open financial system that can be accessed by the world and help people in the conversion of digital currency into and from their local currencies. It is evident from the description that the company provides a platform that connects people who intend to buy, sell, or transfer digital currencies. It also allows the storage of the currency for both the retailers and the institutional investors. The technology company achieves this through various products and functions, with the Coinbase app being its primary product. Coinbase's intended customers are retail and institutional investors targeting any investor irrespective of their knowledge and understanding of Cryptocurrency. 

    According to Lo (2021), Coinbase has 53 million users, and it operates in more than 100 countries. Maesa et al., (2019) assert that Coinbase competitive advantage is that it was among the first crypto trading platforms and one of the most popular trading platforms. When a digital asset is listed in Coinbase, it realizes a "Coinbase effect," which results in a surge in the digital asset's value. Maesa et al. (2019) argue that with mistrust in the many emerging digital assets, "Coinbase effect" stands as a reputable platform, which is an important advantage. 

    Coinbase uses blockchain technology for its trading. According to Wanjun and Yuan (2018), the technology is based on decentralized distributed ledgers, which record the various transactions and their details. It cannot be modified once a transaction has been made, thus making it legitimate. The transactions are adjusted across the different decentralized ledgers, updating one's assets based on the transactions. Wanjun and Yuan (2018) add that it is for this reason and the technology that Coinbase does not need a physical office and presence to manage the trading and its other operations.

## Landscape

    Coinbase is in the financial markets trading domain of the financial industry. It allows the transfer and exchange of financial assets that are in digital form. There have been various trends in the financial markets and trading industry. According to Schmidhuber (2021), firstly, there have been changes in the products offered in the market. The arrays of products in the market have been largely influenced by technology. 

    According to Oxford Analytica (2021), Coinbase was listed on the Nasdaq through the direct listing on April 14, 2021. The listing would open the way for many other digital currency exchange companies to be listed. There has been caution and reservation in allowing the digital currencies companies and other similar organizations to join the mainstream finance space. However, Oxford Analytica (2021) argues that with the listing of Coinbase through a direct listing, many other similar organizations are expected to be accepted for listing. Oxford Analytica (2021) asserts that the direct listing process requires some due process and evaluation of the company. Coinbase, having gone through the process and met the conditions for listing, would provide the necessary benchmark for other companies to the following process.

    Lai and Whitlow (2020) argue that Coinbase operations opened up various regulatory measures for Cryptocurrency operations. Coinbase played an important role in the validation of the trading in cryptocurrencies. Various regulatory frameworks were based on the organization and its operations. The arguments by Lai and Whitlow (2020) are supported by the views by Oxford Analytica (2021) on the acceptance of Coinbase in mainstream finance that would open up ways and paths for other trading companies within the space. Measures such as the Coinbase effects, which acted as market validation for a particular coin, proved the ability of the platform to validate the coins that are listed and thus providing a milestone for the digital assets. Lai and Whitlow (2020) describe it as evidence of trust on the platform as a trading platform.

## Measurement of Performace

    Moniruzzaman et al. (2020) discuss the various metrics employed in evaluating success measurement. According to Moniruzzaman et al. (2020), one of the core measures is the number of users and the volume of usage, which determines the market share that it holds. Coinbase has 53 million users. It is the most popular crypto exchange, followed by Binance, then Robinhood, then Gemini, and finally Kraken.  However, Moniruzzaman et al. (2020) list Coinbase to be the most expensive platform, while it has extended the amount of cryptocurrencies it offers, there are other exchanges that offer many more. The brand also has few payment options that limits the level of exchanges with fiat currencies. Moniruzzaman et al. (2020) argue that the popularity of the platform, despite these disadvantages, makes it a superior product compared to the other competitors. 

    The second measure of success within the Landscape is its listing in the stock market. According to Liu et al.,(2021) most companies not only the Fin-tech companies but companies in every industry seek public listing which is a milestone and a measure of success for these organization. Liu et al., (2021) argues that in the Cryptocurrency world listing in the stock market is also a measure of validation and trust by the mainstream market. Coinbase is the only company that has been listed in the mainstream market among its competitors. This makes it stand out as a successful company among its peers within the industry. 

## Recommendations

    Coinbase has products for individual retail traders and institutional traders. The company has also developed a payment service for merchants, the Coinbase card that allows customers to spend their cryptocurrencies and stable coins that allows the customers to exchange cryptocurrencies. With these set of services, the company should consider having a Cryptocurrency ATM. There are Bitcoin ATMs in various locations across the globe. From the assessment of the assortment of products and services that the company has, it should consider providing a holistic experience of the financial services for its clients through the ATMs. 

    Coinbase should maintain the block chain technology that it uses in its operations. The technology is secure and it represents the idea that Coinbase represents which are decentralized operations.  The popularity of the technology is expected to increase with time and extensive integration with different operations and service providers is imminent. These aspects will be instrumental in the success and performance of the organization in the provision of its services within its industry of operation. The company will be able to yield from the emerging technology and gain as the establishing company for the technology.
